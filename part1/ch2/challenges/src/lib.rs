// ch2 challenges

// 1. define a higher-order function / function object "memoize":
//
//      takes a pure function f as arg, returns a function that behaves like f
//      but only calls f once for each arg, stores result internally, returns 
//      stored result when called with same argument. this improves performance, so 
//      try a f that is slow. 

// 2. try to memoize a function to produce random numbers. Does it work? -- prolly not since
// entropy makes it not a pure function??

// 3. make a fn that takes a seed, calls RNG with seed, returns result. Memoize this function. 
// Does it work?

// 4. <about C++ fns>

// 5. How many Hask are there from Bool to Bool? implement them all. 

// 6. Draw a picture of a category whose objects are the types Void, (), Bool, with arrows 
//  possible fns between these types. Label arrows.
